.SH NAME
\fBtpty\fP \- tpty execute the program in a session of its own, connected to a pseudo terminal.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtpty\fP [ -x -f config ] [ -t timeout -d driver ] [ -einuvXI -o outfile -r recordfile -a auditfile -p RSAPrivateKey -k EncrypedKey ] program [ args ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtpty\fP disables the output buffering that occurs when program ouput is redirected.
For example, suppose you are watching the output of Background-Running Job,
You can disable this automatic buffering as follows:
.nf

        tpty -i \fIprogram\fP < /dev/null > file.out &

.fi
If a coprocess used the standard I/O library for its input and output:
.nf

        execl(program, program, (char *)0);
        
.fi
we will not talk to the coprocess across a pipe, because the standard I/O library 
fully buffered the standard input and standard output, leading to a deadlock. If we
run the coprocess under \fBtpty\fP:
.nf

        execl("/usr/bin/tpty", "tpty", "-e", program, (char *)0);
        
.fi
the program now works, even if the coprocess uses standard I/O.

Using the \fBtpty\fP, we can implement the \fBscript(1)\fP program as the following
shell script:
.nf

        #!/usr/bin/ksh
        tpty "${SHELL:-/usr/bin/ksh}" | tee typescript
        
.fi
or
.nf

        #!/usr/bin/ksh
        tpty -o typescript "${SHELL:-/usr/bin/ksh}"
        
.fi



Using the \fBtpty\fP, we can "talk" to the interactive programs noninteractively 
like the \fBexpect(1)\fP.
The option (\fB\-d\fP) allows \fBtpty\fP to be connected to a driver process for
its input and output. The standard output of the driver is \fBtpty\fP's standard input and
vice versa.

\fBtpty\fP provides the option (\fB\-x\fP) for default driver, if use default driver,
you must specify the config file (\fB\-f\fP). The config file's format like:
.nf

    ExpectString%SendReply%<TptyReserveWords>

.fi
The following is an example of an config file:
.nf

	login: % foo
	foo's Password: % password
	foo@host:[/]# % date "+%y%m%d"
	foo@host:[/]# % exit

.fi
.PP
The field separator is \fBthe first\fP '%'. \fBtpty\fP looks for the 
ExpectString in the interactive program's output,
inputs the SendReply if the pattern matched. That means:
.nf

    case Output matched:
            ExpectString1)
                    SendReply1; break;
            ExpectString2)
                    SendReply2; break;
            ...

.fi

The config file can use the regular expression, since if the ExpectString
has symbol '%', you can use '.' to replace it.
The symbols and subroutines is from \fBregex\fP. You must precede them with a \\ (backslash)
if you want to match the special symbol itself. For example, \\$ matches a dollar sign.
.nf

    login: %foo 
    foo's Password: %password 
    foo@host:[/]# % shell-cmd 
    \fB.*\\[.*\\].*% shell-cmd\fP 
    foo@host:[/]# % exit

.fi
Note, the pattern match do not ignore the \fBBLANK\fP.
The TptyReserveWords
is \fBNONR, REPEAT, INTERACT, ENCRYPT\fP. The 
.B NONR
means do not input the newline key (like '\\r').
The
.B REPAET
means:
.nf

    while (Output matched ExpectString)
        SendReply;

.fi
The
.B INTERACT
means:
.nf

    if (Output matched ExpectString)
            do the rest thing manually;

.fi
.B INTERACT
must be used with
.B \-I
option.

Here is another sample of a config file:
.nf

    ogin: %foo
    assword: %secret
    .*# % cat LargeFile | more
    --More--%j% <NONR> % <REPEAT>
    .*# % <INTERACT>

.fi

The
.B ENCRYPT
is added by
.B tpty-crypt
automatically, no need add the word manually.
The
.B tpty-crypt
and
.B tpty-keygen
are used to encrypt the sensitive fields of the config file.
You should use
.B tpty-keygen
to generate an RSA keypair with a 2048 bit private key
and extract the public key from the RSA keypair in PEM format:
.nf

    $ tpty-keygen ./private.pem
    Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
    .+++
    ...+++
    e is 65537 (0x10001)
    writing RSA key
    private key : ./private.pem
    public  key : ./private.pem.pub 

.fi
Then you can encode the config file with
.B tpty-crypt
The syntax is
.nf

    \fBtpty-crypt\fP FileName SegmentName PublicKey StoreFile

.fi
The
.I SegmentName
is which segment you want to encode, like "password" etc.
The
.I StoreFile
is the file which is used to stored the encrypted segment.
For example, The original file is
.nf

    assword: % secret
    .*# % whoami
    .*# % exit

.fi
After executing the following command:
.nf

    $ tpty-crypt config "assword:" private.pem.pub config.key

.fi 
The config file will become:
.nf 

    assword: %<ENCRYPT>
    .# % whoami
    .# % exit

.fi
The encrypted key is stored in config.key.

When the config file is ready, you can execute the following command:
.nf

        tpty -x -f \fIconfig\fP telnet remote-host

.fi

If the file is encrypted, execute:
.nf

        tpty -x -f \fIconfig\fP -p private.pem -k config.key telnet remote-host

.fi

Because the 
.B tpty
creates a session with a pseudo terminal,
even you can write the driver program yourself to talk to the pseudo terminal.
.nf

        tpty -d \fIdriver\fP program [ args ... ]

.fi

.SH OPTIONS
Valid options are:
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fIauditfile\fP
File containing all input from stdin, including the stty in noecho mode.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdriver\fP
Specifies the driver program for stdin/stdout.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
Does not echo characters for slave pty's line discipline.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIconfig\fP
Specifies the config file for default driver, must use \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-x\fP flags together.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Ignore EOF on standard input.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP \fIEncryptedKey\fP
Specifies the file which save the encrypted segment of the config file.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
No interactive mode.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIoutfile\fP
Designates the file to be used for the program output.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIRSAPrivateKey\fP
Specifies the RSA private key to decrypt the config file.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrecordfile\fP
Output timing data to \fIrecordfile\fP.
This data contains two fields, separated by a space.
The first field indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.
The second field indicates how many characters were output this time.
This information can be used to replay outfile (-o) with realistic typing and output delays.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fItimeout\fP
If after timeout, none of interactive program's output have been seen, \fBtpty\fP
will exit. If you don't specify the \fB-x\fP option,
the \fBtimeout\fP will be ignored. Default timeout is 10 seconds. If \fBtimeout\fP < 0, will
wait forever.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP
Unlink the encrypted key file (specified by \fB\-k\fP option).
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Verbose mode. It only displays the slave pty's device name, not is very helpful for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
Choose default driver. Must use \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-x\fP flags together, it will interpret the
config file, drive interactive programs in noninteractive modes.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP
Redirect output to /dev/null if use the default driver.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP
If you don't want to completely automate a task with a driver
(\fB\-d\fP or \fB\-x\fP), the \fB\-I\fP option is to automate
some of it and then do the rest manually.
For example, if the
.I config's
(\fB\-f\fP) content is:
.nf

        assword: %TopSecret
        .*# % <INTERACT>

.fi
When execute:
.nf

	tpty -I -x -f \fIconfig\fP ssh remote-host

.fi
Now consider doing this manually.

.SH NOTES
Certain interactive commands, such as
\fBvi(1)\fP, create garbage in the outfile (-o).
.B tpty
works best with commands that do not manipulate the screen,
the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.

.SH Exit Status
This command returns the following exit values:
.TP
\fB0\fP
Successful completion.
.TP
\fB>0\fP
An error occurred.

.SH BUGS
If
.B tpty
with
.B -o
option,
it will place
.I everything
in the output file, including linefeeds and backspaces.  This is not what the
naive user expects.

.SH HISTORY
.B tpty
The prototype of
.B tpty
was 
.B pty
what was written by W.Richard Stevens for APUE.
Gong Cun implemented the default driver for interactive programs 
with other features, was inspired by 
.B expect(1)
and GNU/Linux
.B script(1)
utility.
The
.B tpty
worked on AIX, GNU/Linux and MacOSX.
