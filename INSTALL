1. Install the tpty* program

Run the following command to install

    $ ./config.sh
    $ make
    $ make install

If the config.sh can't find the OpenSSL library, will not install the tpty-crypt
program. If you have installed the OpenSSL library, please setup the environment 
variable:

    $ export LDFLAGS=-L<path>
    $ export CPPFLAGS=-I<path>
    $ ./config.sh
    $ make -e
    $ make install

You also can alter the compiler:

    $ make CC=foo


2. Install the vtclean program

You should install the ruby first, then

    $ cd vtparse
    $ make vtclean
